summary: The main part of the presentation of Viktor Ilieff was the creaating of the audio and video materials. The best  way to present an artist is the honestly first-person sharing of his work. This is why the significant part of the video materials had been taken from the first-person story of the conductor and his personal successes and what he thinks about his art.

# Tell your story
The main part of the presentation of Viktor Ilieff was the creaating of the audio and video materials. The best  way to present an artist is the honestly first-person sharing of his work. This is why the significant part of the video materials had been taken from the first-person story of the conductor and his personal successes and what he thinks about his art. 

In our work with Victor Ilieff we had to present his orchestra. We had to create an international musical project, which unite musicans from all Europe and rehearsing in Romania. This is where we filmed the vide and audio materials, which showed professionalism of the musicans and their glamor. We used the opportunity to create pictures, which was used in the web desing of the website.

## The most serious challenge
The most serious challenge in the filming the full range of multimedia materials was the low budget and the less time and also the fact that the records took place ouside Bulgaria. The project was quite huge and interesting and the whole process of logistic and the coordination was our obligation. The main responsibility was the filming of the video, which required a lot of cameras, combines with the sound, recoded from over 20 microphones. All of this requirements of the filming and the image processing had be very well organized.

 No one from the participants cannot took place in the images and videos processing, because of theirs engagements. This is why the coordinting of the processs and the communication between Romania, Germany and Bulgaria was extremely important part of the successful realization of the project. Thanks to the serious work during the processing of the images and the videos, we created video, which met the expectations of the pre-set goals and present in the best way the skills and the potential of Viktor Ilieff and his orchestra.
