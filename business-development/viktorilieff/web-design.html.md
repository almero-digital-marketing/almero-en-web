# Music, talent and hard working
We created a website that will impresses with its style and to differ from the cliches in this field. We chose the design to be modern, clean and prime, but not simple. In the center of our work was [Viktor Ilieff](http://viktorilieff.com/) and his work.

It took a lot of time to collect and arrange the information. Together with the conductor we created the concept of the content of the website and the main slogans of the articles.

We predicted the implemention of lot of multimedia products that will diversify the huge amount of content. The professional captured images and video  materials, were the best way to present the repertoire of Viktor Ilieff. We spent a special attention on the presentation of the orchestra, leaded by Viktor Ilieff, and his participation on the international scenes.
