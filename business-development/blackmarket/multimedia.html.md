# Introduceing your product to the people
The creating of the series of video materials were one of the most essential moments from the advertising of the service. They were the main tool in attracting more clients. The content on the website is not so important for the attractive presenting of a styling, than the good multimedia presence.

## The content and the structure suffered some changes in the tme
To provide a regular publishing of the video materials with the necessary frequency we planned and filmed a huge number of video clips. Their topics and content had growth up in the time, with an unison with the differences with the challenges upfront of Black Market. The first video materials, was telling a first hand stories â€“ the clients of the workshop helped us to present their point of view, showing their new styling. We published all of them in facebook and the shares among the fans of the facebook page helped us to get the initial clients feed. 

## Professionalism and an attention to the details
The second series of video materials popularize the service, showing the whole working process, focusing on the professionalism and the attention, just like Black Market works on every single project. The main challenge in these video clips was that we had to present one comparatively boring service, like sewing, in a attractive and interesting way.
