# A business idea
The difference between this project and the others, on which we have been working was that the client came to us with a simple idea for a business with made-to-measure clothes. Together with Black Market we developed a conception for the service and its promoting - defining of the target groups and what should be the the price range of the products.

In the developing of the strategy for digital marketing we had to focus not only on the fact that we are going to advertise a not so popular service, but also to deal with the low budget. 

## The unique specifications of the service created some difficulties
Our first step was to gave some clarifications about the service, which Black Market offers and to defined that this not just a company for custom-made clothes, but a place where you can get a complete new look-alike. The unique of the service created some difficulties in defining the price range and its positioning on the market. We wanted to featured the company from its competitor - fashion boutique and stores in the malls, so we showed how the ordinary people feel in the clothes and the fact that the clothes differ depending on the appearance of every single person.

##  We spent a significant attention on the presenting of the service
It was not a suprise that one of our methods was to show the proffesional material and the working process, presented by an ordinary people. After we succesfully imposed Black Market as a workshop for custom-made clothes, we decided to placed a fashion line with DJ Marten. The decision we made gave a new look and a new perspective in the developing of Black Market.
