# Focusing on one advertising channel
The analyzes were one of the most important part of the whole working process on Black Market. Because of the low budget, we had to focus on just one advertising channel and to be sure that this is the most effective one. We tested different advertising channels,  which gave us a lot the information about the service, not only about the most valuable option for advertising of Black Market, but also for the client behaviour and etc.

As like as the other projects, it was from an extremely importance to be able to appraise the information we had gained, dependable of the effective of each of the channels. Our extensive experience in creating advertising campaigns allowed us to be prepared and to be able to know what to expect and when to perform changes, if the resuls do not math with the previously planning of the project.
