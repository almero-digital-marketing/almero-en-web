# To develop with the company
We chose a sample and clear web design for Black Market and put the focus on the clothes, sewed by the company.  The web design had to combine the different colour schemes with the variety of pictures, without being obsessive.

The another feature for which we had to thought about was the option to add a large amount of information about the company, because not only the service wasn`t so popular, but the porfolio of Black Market was getting bigger and bigger. Moreover it had to be developed in an unison with the fast increasing portfolio. We provided the website with the feature for easily adding of video materials, iamges and the sketches of the clothes.

# Interesting presenting of the service
We relied on a strategy that will attract the potential clients with an interesting representing of the service that will provoke them to view as many pages as they can. In order not to be boring the web design had to allowed fast loading and also to be adjusted for changes in the structure and for SEO optimization. To make sure that the information about the service is well arranged and visitors will find all they need, each of the pages had to show a specific product and moreover to throw light on the service that Black Market offers.

Pernament updating of the websites with articles for each styling required a strict images and files transfer. We created a system for file transfer, which made the working process easier and exclude the possibility for any errors.
