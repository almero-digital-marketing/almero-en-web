# Good things takes time
The working process of creating the multimedia materials was developed in two several  ways – the part of our work was in the image processing, oriented for publishing on the web site, on the Facebook page and on the blog and on the second part of our work was oriented to the aranging, recording, editing and advertising of a niche related video.

We decided to relied on the video materials as the best way to present the advantages and the benefits of the precise interior design in interesing and fascinating way. Thanks to the video materials we successfully showed the professional work of [Acherno](http://acherno.com). We created a video that represent the whole process, starting from the first contact with the client, through the creating of the interior project and the realization of the product, paying attention to every detail. Creating of video materials took 9 months – the exact duration of the creation of the interior design project that we decided to represent. We were filiming each one of the different stages of of the project, while they were working, and we managed to present the whole and in some ways boring and dusty, process of plastering and tiling in an attractive way.

## We reached over 60 000 people
Our efforts had paid off with a quite impressive results. The video successfully show the comprehensive work on one interior design project and the fact that behind the service there is a lot more than only the 3D visualization of one good idea. The visualization, on the other hand, guarantee that the interior design project will be created as it was accepted from the client and thre will be no difeerences among the 3D visualization.

After the end of the advertising campaign, the video material has been seen to an extremely huge amount of people and it was watched from over 40 000 people. The another video, which we created for [Acherno](./../../проекти/ачерно.html), in a short time was also watched from more than 15 000 people.

The regular analisys on our side convinced us that the video materials are the best way to convert the clients from potenetial to real.
