# To combine everyting in one
One of the main rules in our work is that only the precise targeting is be the successful way for making right decisions. That is why we are focusing on the methodology for analizing the information from a different channels â€“ web site, advertising channels and Facebook page, so we can make a better prediction on what will be the most valuable way to be used to improve your business. We make a customer research of the transformation of your clients from potential to real. This gives us the confidence that we are making the righ decisions for the choice of an advertising channel.

In the beginning of our work on the advertising of the business of [Acherno](http://acherno.com) the analyses was very intensive. In the maintime we decided to change the method of analising from daily to monthy. The gained results from the researches gave us the advantage to predict the results of the advertising campaigns and the reactions among the potential clients. The excellent know-how of the features of the market, combined with the basis for comparison, guarantee us the high efficiency from the design and the structure of the web site and the advertising campaigns.
