# The continuous work gives great results
The growth in the social networks was one of the singnificant goals in the whole marketing strategy of “Acherno”. The main challenge was to use the potential of the company, without losing the focus on the target group. Our aim was not only to attract a lot of people as a potential clients, but also to keep them on the [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/acherno.ltd) and to create a long-term relationships. This obligated us to publish trending and interesting information, beautiful images and video materials, which will increase the engagement.
We took a maximum advantage from the opportunities, which Facebook gives – frequent actualization and uploading a high amount of information.

To increase the interes and the curiosity of the potential clients, we created two separated applications: for [price sorting of the successful projects](https://www.facebook.com/acherno.ltd/app_197219130300165) and for [tematic arrangment of the successful projects with an easier navigation](https://www.facebook.com/acherno.ltd/app_162455107159632).

## A source of clients
The result from our work on the overall work on the Facebook page of [“Acherno”] (http://acherno.com) was that we have already attracted over 74 00 potential clients, who volunterary liked the page of the conmapy for interior design.
