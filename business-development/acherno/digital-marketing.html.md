# A strategy that will resist the challenges of the time
The whole conception about the digital marketing of Acherno was built on the idea to be in a long-term plan. It had to be enought flexible and effective for a start – up workshop, but also to be appropriate for a serious company, leader in the sector of the interior design services. This is why the digital marketing strategy was developing at the same time with the whole service operations of the company.

## Making the right changes
The challenges, which we had to face up at the beginning were so much different from these after the expansion of Acherno. The goals and the cases, which we had to solved up, were different. In the time, while we were working on the project, we changed the way in which we represething Acherno. We took a look of the communication channels and the messages we were sending to the target group.

## To pay attention on the details
In the begging our efforts were focused to get people familiar with the interior desing as a service. In that days Acherno still didn`t have a big portfolio. In the same time the service was not well known from the most of the people. We started to advertise the workshop as a company, which provides high quality, but also not so expensive service, not only available for a few well-off and rich people. We oriented it for a modern thinking people, who carry on the good work and value their own time.

Later then, when the company has already become one of the leaders in the sector, we had to find the most fascinating and interesing way to represent the huge amount of projects in the portfolio. We insisted on the leadership position, using some PR articles, the opportunities that the social networks gives us and focusing on SEO optimization.

In the begging of our work the asspect was to focus on getting new customers. However, after the company develop our efforts was focused on managing the clients` feed, speeding up the work processes of the team and the client servicing with integrating new technologies.
