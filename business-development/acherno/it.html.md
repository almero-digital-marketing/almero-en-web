# High technology effectivity
We put on the table and developed an overall solution for software and hardware automatisation of the working process of "Acherno". We added software with open source code as an alternative of the paid software and we managed to reduce the costs for licensed software. 

All of the programs and applications are integrated in a way to achieve full optimization of the working processes, the file transter and the client`s servicing. The process of developing and integrating the system called "Digital Asset Managment", which allows perodical synchronization and the back up of information, guarantee reliability and reduces to minimum the option of any wrong comands in the system. 

We created an online application for rending 3D images - "Whitebox". The application significantly reduce the loading speed and saved a huge amount of money for technical maintain of the process.

## Smoothly transfer of information
The process of creating the articles on the web site and the [Facebook page](https://www.facebook.com/acherno.ltd) was in synchron with the work on the others projects of Acherno. To reach faster and smoother file transfering we created a special system, which can receive the neccesary information, without the assist of the studyo for interior design. In the same time the system significantly improved the communication with the clients and sub-contractors. With the assistance of the informative tehcnologies we successfully completed the hard task to optimizate and coordinate the processes in "Acherno".
