# To grow up with the company
In the conception of creating the web site we decided that it should evoluate with the company itself.  We prediced the option to change the structure and the content of the web site easily and frequently. We decided that we should make changes depending on the behavior and the reactions of the clients, because of the lack of information and low popularity of the service. This is why the website had to be easy to manage and the structure to allow changes, without any affections on the Google overall ranking in the search results.

## To keep the potential clients
In the first stage of the project we focused on the presenting of the service â€“ what it includes and what are the the benefits from it. Later then, the focus moved on the presenting the the portfolio of the successful projets that inspire professionalism, which guarantee that in the end there wouldn`t be any differences between prevoisly accepted model from the client and the the final result.

## To keep the pontential clients

One of our main targets was to keep the potential clients as long as possible on the website. This is why the webiste design was oriented to load as fastest as it can. We took a plenty of time on creating an interesting content, just to be attractive for the visitor. We decided to bank on a simple design, interesting pictures and the 3D visualizations of the projects. 

In same time, except the website, we created and a [blog](http://www.interiorendizain.com), too. Its purpose is to give more detailed information about the service and to be an option for easily commucation with the potential clients.
