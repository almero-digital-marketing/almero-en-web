# The pictures change everything
The professional photo session, which we  performed, was the basis for the digital marketing strategy of the dental service of 'Beautiful smile”. We created the intial creative vision, which had to be in unison with the preliminary targets on the project: to craete a new vision of the dental office and to show a different attitude to the service.

We used the dental office as a place, where we took the photos. We took the maximum benefits from the place, where the photos were taken. To represent the six thematic scenes we hired a professional photographer and models, the necessary props, a makeup artist and a hairdresser. The filming of every scene required a different makeup, hairstyles, props, lighting and a rearrangement of the décor. In the end of the sessions the pictures received an extra computer processing.

## An impressive result
The final result impresses because of the unique vision, despite of the low budget and the short period of time, in which the phtoto session was made.
