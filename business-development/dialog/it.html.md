# No compromises with the loading speed
The hosting of the website on our own data center, where we had a full control on the servers allowed us without any concerns to proceed from the old to the new configuration without stopping the working process of the company. For our work on the project it was very important to achieve a high loading speed. To provided it on one hand, we reduced the content and imporoved the desing of the website, from the other hand â€“ we provided a virtual server, which guaratee a significantly better loading speed and acccesabilty to the website compared with the shared hosting, used before we started to work on the project. 

The new system that we created gave us more reliable and systemized information about the requests and the interests of the clients. We managed to analyze it for the needs of the marketing strategy.
