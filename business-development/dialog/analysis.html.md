# To act fast
We started our work on the project with a defining of the strong and weak sides of the existing website of “Kitchens Dialog” and the online presence at all. We had an information about the current market situation of the company after the compairing analysis, which helped us to get a valuable information about the behaviour of the potential clients. This information was in the basis for the developing of the new software and a starting point in appraising the progress on the targets.

Following this tendency the number of real clients also increased.
