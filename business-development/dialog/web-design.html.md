# To prove that you are the best
The result from the launching of the the new website was beyond the expectations – there was a significant increasing of the average duration of the visitors on the website and also a high percent of reducing of the dropped visitors from the website. We also got a feedback from the showroom that some of the clients had took an actiion after they visit the webiste of the company.

## A preliminary analysis
The preliminary analysis showed us that one of reasons for the reduced clients feed and the low sales of  “Kitchens Dialog” is the design of the website and the obscure slogans in the presenting of the company. This is why our job was not only limited to the re-design of the exciting website. We took a lot of time in creating the structure and the content, which will provoke the clients to make an action – making requests or directly to visit the showroom.

Our work on the web design and the structure of the website started with the selection of the most appropriate and the most impressive pictures we got from the client. The studio quality photos allowed us to show the kitchens and their elements in their full magnificence. Our previous experience in the promoting of products and services in the sector of the interior design gave us the confidence that we had presented the kitches in the most attractive and successful way.

## A clean web design 
We choice a clean web design of the website to stand out the beauty of the kitchens and to underlined the professionalism in their design and manufacturing. In the same time the design of the new website had to keep the coorporative indentity and the new structure and content had to avoid losing ranking in the Google organich results.

The huge amount of pictures, which the website contains and the high organic traffic hidded a risk from a problems with the loading speed. This was one of the reasons for the high dropping percent of the visitors on the previous website. This is why to took a lot of time on the image processing of the pictures – we had to reduce to minimum the loading time of the pages, without any negative effects on the pictures.
