#  You sell what you present
We created a video that presents to the clients the services and the products, which they can actually find in the showroom. It has to be accomplished at a very high level and to be as good as the professional videos for the kitchens. It main goal was to give a real perspective for the quality of the materials and the creation of the kitchens and to build trust. To reach the desired effect, we took a lot of time on the processing of the frames and the postproduction. 

## Dynamics with a lot of movement
The plot of the presentation didn`t suggests attractive presentaton, so we created a dynamics with a lot of movement of the camera. We also did an extra video mounting to clear out the frames and to adjsut the colours and the lighting.
