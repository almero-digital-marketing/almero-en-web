title: Fast and reliable
description: One of the leaders in the interior design - “Acherno” has trusted in Whitebox in its work, which is a gurantee for a reliability and a high effectivity of the application.  
summary: The solution of the problem is in the developing of a system, which allows to reduce the time for generating of a computer images with adding an additional computing resources to the system. This software makes the computer images to generate in a just few minutes. This is increasing the speed time, without being compesated by the quality of the image.

# The speed is over everything
The project is a partnership with “Acherno” - A studio for interior design. This is a perfect example of how the high technologies can make the work goes fast and smoothly and to increase the effectivity of the working process. 
For a succesful developing of such kind of a comlicated infrastructure projects , it is very important to have a strong technical background, but there is a lot more. The deploying of the full potential of such kind of projects also require some financial funds.  

## A private cloud
The combination of  an easy to use product with a high realiability and effectivity requires not only a significant hardware technologies, but also a software, which can optimize the working process of the software products, providing more speed. The solution of the problem hides in the developing of a system, which allows to reduce the time for generating of a computer images with adding an additional computing resources to the system. This software makes the computer images to generate in a just few minutes Our experience in the interior design, shows that the time for generating of one high quality image takes between 6 and 10 hours, using a modern highly productive working station. Thanks to the functionality of Whitebox this time is reduced to 5-10 minutes. An another important specification of the product is the that its computing capabilities can be used from a several people, that work on a different projects, at the same time, on a different working stations. Using of Whitebox does not require an additional training of the employees and does not make the work more complicated.  

## A confidence in the whole system 
The guarantee of the reability of the whole system requires a permanent monitoring and fixing of the mistakes. This was completed with collecting and analizing of a big sources of information in a long test period. 
One of the leaders in the interior design - “Acherno” trusts on Whitebox in its work, which is a gurantee for a reliability and a high effectivity of the application.
