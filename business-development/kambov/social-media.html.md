# Long-term relationships and engagement
The social networks were a suitable platform for informing and educating the patients of dr. Kambov. The presence there was very well targeted to the right audience. The information, images and the video materials in Facebook had a complementary role to the website, the blog and the social network succesfuly became the major channel for communication and keeping the high interest among the patients. 

We were looking for a long-term relationships and high engagement. Without any bounght fans and relying only on the voluntarily participation we provoked the people by themselves to like the page. We published an interesting materials and soon the page has been liked by over 2000 people.

## Guess the filling
One of the wining decisions was the creation of the series of games called “Guess the filling”. The games did not only keep the interes of the Facebook fans in a funny and interesting way, but also let us published pictures showing the precise work and the excellent results from the practice of dr. Kambov.  Thanks to the campaign, we increased the credence on the work of dr. Kambov and developed a well-known brand on a high profesional level and to expand the range of potential clients.
