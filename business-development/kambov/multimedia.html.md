The first video material that we filmed, to check what is the interest in such kind of presence of the service was about the benefits from the oral hygiena, and it was watched by 17 000 visitors. After we convicted in the benefits of the first video, we planned and filmed series of thematic videos, which attracted more clients, found out in the videos a solution for their problems.
