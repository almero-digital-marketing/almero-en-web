# An online dental database for the patients
One of the main challenges and an undoupted advantage  in our work on the project was the fact we had to present a standart service, like the dental one, in a modern and interesting way. We wanted to present the dental office of dr. Kambov as a place, where the patiets gets a high quality service on a reasonable price.

We created an online dental database, to engage a long-term relantionships with the patients and to increase not just their confidence in the service, but  their loyalty, too. The online dental database allows everyone to check out the progress of his treatment and to plan the future dental evaluations. We predicted the option the online databates to be not just personal, but also family.  The family dental database successfully combined the effect of the new innovations , increased the motivation and the discipline of the patients.

## Increasing of the effectivity in the working of the dental office.
We integrated an online dental database with an SMS notifacation system for making appointments. In the day of visiting the dental office, the patients receives a SMS, remined him for the sheduled appointment. This significantly optimized the working process of the dental office, reducing the missed dental evaluations from the patients. Even if any of the evaluations are cancelled they can be can easily transferred to some other patients. The results were excellent. The efficiency of working has increased and the patients became more satisfied from the better organization.
