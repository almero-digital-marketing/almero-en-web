# Looking for informative patients
We started with a simple website, with the purpose to get the visitors well-known with the practice of dr. Kambov. In the first version of the website  the content and the images showed the working process in the dental office of dr. Kambov. Our goal was the patients to get well-known with his work, before they had even made an appointment.

We chose to present the separeted services in a way, which focused on the results from the treatment. That was in unison with the idea of the website - to be informative, with a lot of interesting and valuable for the visitors content and in the same time to cover all of the requirements for an excellent SEO optimization.

## Easy changes and actualization of the website
The structure of the webiste has been created in a way that will allow us to make easily changes in the future. In the time, while we was working on the project we changed the structure and the vision of the website three times, until we found the best design, which will be the most attractive for the visitors. For us it was very important every potential client, who is browsing the website, to be provoked to read or to watch all of the useful for his health materials and to call or to visit the dr.Kambov`s dental office.

We rounded up the content of the website with articles in the blog, where we have regularly published useful information and specific articles on a concrete topics.
