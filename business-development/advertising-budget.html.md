We calculate the advertising budget, according to the targets and your financial resources. The advertising strategy is divided on the diffrent types of ads and advertising channels. We precisely choose where to advertise, following the rule for a precise targeting in the best price. After we have already started, we make an optimization of the expenses, so we can insist on the most effective campaign that will convert more sales on a lowest price.
