# Video campaign that presents dr. Lilia Guduleva as a professional
The videos, in their main part, were oriented in honestly first-person presenting of dr. Guduleva as a specialist in estetic medicine. This is why she was the main person in the photo sessions, too. Each and all of the photos had to present her in a way that will inspire confidence in her skills.

We relied on the same method in filming the series of short video materials, in which dr. Guduleva explains in a ordinary language the qualities of the estetic medicine for each of the zones of the face. Our previous experience has learned us that the video materials are extremely effective in creating a credence in the potential cliens. Paying a serious attention on the montage and the post-production were with a significant importance for the success of the video campaign.
