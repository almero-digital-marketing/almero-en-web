# SEO optimization as a part of the whole marketing strategy
After the massive advertising campaign we had enough data to analize the behaviour of our clients. After we already knew what our clients want to see in the website, we decided to move on with the optimization for the organic results in Google.

We put the focus on two main parts of the optimization – working on the content of the website and creating a network of links – linkbuilding. In creating the text of the website we followed all of the requirements for a quality content, which will be valuable for the visitors. We relied on a SEO strategies, which will focus on the most important keywords from the content, while someone is search in Google for information about the service or aesthetic medicine at all.  We built a wide range of thematic links to improve the ranking in the organic results in Google. We connect the links to the keywords, describing the business of dr. Guduleva, but also matching with the keywords, for which people are searching over the Internet.
