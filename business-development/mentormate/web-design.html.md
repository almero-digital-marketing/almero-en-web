We wanted to show the competitive advantages of “Mentormate” and the attitude to the employees. We presented the crews and the opportunies that came with the work – valuable knowledge, growth opportunities and the chance to make individual decisions on the work on the projects.

We took a series of meetings with the supervisor of the technical crews to became well acquainted with the working process in the company, to collect, to structure and the show the necessary information and to present it in the most impressive way. Everything had to be completed in a very short terms, because we had to continue with the next stage – promoting of the new look and interviews for hiring of employees.
