# Change the idea for yourself
The result from our work was more than succesful, after within 9 months, “Mentormate” hire more than 120 people. The analisys showed that the campaign that we performed, gave better and lasting results for a less time with a lower cost, comparing with  a standart campign for a staff recruitment from a HR specialists.

## Where to stance on the market
The main case study that we have to solve before start acting was, where to stance the foreign company on the market in Bulgaria. The overall presence of Mentormate was as the same as this in USA, which was absolutely irrelevant on the goals that we had to achive here in Bulgaria.  If the overall target group group in USA was the final clients in Bulgaria we had to focus on the current and potential employees. This is why on of our steps was an overall re-design and new content of the website.

## Take an advantage of your skills
To reach the targets we had to change the overall attitude to the company and to publish a lot of possitive information for “Mentormate”. We put the focus to present the company in the best way a front of the IT specialists in Bulgaria. We emphasized on promoting the vission of the company, about the way in which it wants to develop and underlined its advantages compared with the others IT companies in Bulgaria. We put the focus on the size of the company and the large number of projects, which provides a dynamic and interesting work and opportunities for growing in the company for the employees. All of theis information had to be presented in an intelligent and attractive way for the target group in a way that in just one year it had to turned over the attitudes and let the company to hire more than 100 new employees.

## Pay an attention on the details
A very important part in the creating of the new image of “Mentormate” were the job offers, that we had to publish. They had to sound interesting, to be out of cliches and in the same time to be informative enough to explained he conditions and the opportunities in the company.
