# The company from its first side
We chose to present the company from its first side, so it will provoke confidence and interest. To achieve this goal we filmed and montaged series of interewies with some of the key people in “Mentormate”. They gave more information about the job offers, the opportunities and the company at all. The interviews took a very important part in the overall look of the new cooperative website.
