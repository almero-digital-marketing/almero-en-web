# With a concrete target
Our main task was to help the company in hiring new employees in a specific period of time. We made a detailed plan of the way that the company will be presented. The vital part of our work was that the target group were not the clients of the company. We had to focus on the professionals that will have an interest to start working there.

When MentorMate got in touch with us they was a front of a serious challenge. To complete the newly-signed contracts with their clients, that had to hire over 100 developers and QA specialist in the next 12 monts,  which looks “almost” impossible, according to the lakc of popularity of the company.
