# A long-term results
In a result of the marketing campaign MentoMate hired more than 120 developers in 9 months. The overall company reputation was reshaped and we increased the feed of a high qualified candidates. The method that we chose gave a better and long-term result, than using an ordinary HR agency. 

## A step by step reputation
We created a website that was highly oriented to developers, showing the best sides of the company â€“ working conditions, social benefits, team working, interesting projects and etc. We filmed a series of video materials that was focused on the different sectors and technologies that are important for the employees. We managed to create a few online advertising campaigns that will reach developers that do not currently looking for a new job. This singnificanly increased the range of the pontential candidates, beyond these that are regularly searching the webiste for job offers. We popularize the company with a good SEO optimization, to be sure that its brand name will appear on first page of the organic results, which succesfuly reshaped the reputation of the company a front of the candidates.
