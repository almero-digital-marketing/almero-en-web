# Focused in reaching the top
We made an interesting and innovative website about the practice of Viktor Ilieff. The website contains a lot of  information about Viktor Ilieff and provides all of the answers for someone who is interested in Viktor Ilieff as a composer, conductor and a person at all. The website had to be well constructed and with well arranged content to meet the expectations of the visitors. 

## All you need for a good presentation
We created a series of video materials, which required a complexive organization, logistic and professional montage. Thank to them the personal website of Viktor Ilieff meets all of the expectations and now this the head way for expanding the practice of the young conposer and conductor. This is the only project, on which we do not use SEO optimization and online advertising. Because of the specific target group these ways of promoting wouldn`t be effective.
