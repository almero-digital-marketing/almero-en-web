# We started from the bottom
Our work on the project started with the creating of a busienss plan and defining the main goals and the target groups, planning of the marketing strategy and thinking about how to attract clients that will order custom-made clothes. We created a whole conception for making the service more well-know and preferred option for the choice of a quality clothing and a personal styling.

## We presented a brand new service on the market
The leading marketing method in our work was that the products and the services had to te presented in a very innovative and creative way. We managed to provoked the interest and to create a strong desire in the potential clients to order the service. We managed to achieved this with a well selected visual material and content. The attractive images rounded out the effect of the content, gave more information about the essence of the service and its competitive advantages – professional work, high quality of the materials, unique models and an optimal ratio between price and quality.

## To create a good reputation
We focused on the social presence of the company, which created a reputation of a high quality and unique clothes. We worked with a small advertising budget and combined different channels, until we found the best combination, which can give a maximum result on a low-budget campaigns.

## To show the professionalism in your work
We showed the professionalism in the creating of the clothes with two series of video materials – the first one with the points of view of the clients and the second one that presents the method of sewing of the clothes. With the increasing number of clients we got the opportinuty for expanding of the services of the website of Blackmarket to a new business niche, so we added an online store to the already finished collection of modern clothes.
