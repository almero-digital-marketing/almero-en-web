The challenge in our work on the project was not only in the promotion of the company, but also in the advertising of the service as itself. The first research that we performed showed us that there is a low searcing quares and a moderate competition in this field. 

## Planning and had working
We focused on the presentation of the service in an attractive and understandable way. The most of our part was focused to show to the potential clients what they will get, relying on the professionals in "Acherno" for their interior design.
We changed the content and the design of the website few times, to follow the growing of the company and the expanding of the portfolio. The planning and the managing of the advertising campaigns also showed the changes not only in the company, but also what the clients of the service desire.
