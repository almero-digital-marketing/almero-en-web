# We have a control over the important things
For the needs of our clients we develop and integrate a specific software for documets editing, file transfer and getting in touch with the clients.  The purpose of all of these technologies is to improve the working process, to optimize the workload and to increase the trust and the satisfaction of the clients.  In the most of the cases the software is integrated in the website â€“ as a contact form or a module for an  online shopping.

## Technologies in action
In the most of times in the starting or in the expanding of one business it comes the need of an additional software covering, which will be used for more than just a better online presence. The specific needs of the business define which working processes to be optimized, using the potential of the information technologies to reach the previously planned targets. Our experience showes us that the best results can be reached when they is a connection between the technologies used for a back office and these oriented for more satisfaction of the clients.
